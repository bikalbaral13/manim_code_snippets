class Write_in_nepali(Scene):
    '''
    'font' can be selected as your wish . Here it is "PREETI" , which is Nepali script
    'color' is the font color
    'size' means the font size
    font size is not the same that we use in ms word. here it is scaled up by some factor (assume 20 )
    so here I have written the font size that resembles ms word font size and reduced the size by that factor (20)
    'run_time' does the animation in given time(seconds)
    'Write' writes the text
    'Transform' morphs the first object into another . Here it transforms txt1 into txt2

    You have to import the library of manim in the first line
    In the terminal(cmd), you have to write the command :     manim 'filename' Write_in_nepali -pqk
    and run.
    put -pql for low quality video and -pqk for high quality
